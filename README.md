Ever walk into a store with SO many options for red wine? Lost on which bottle to take home? Well, donâ€™t wine about it no more!! Our revolutionary application utilizes machine learning to rate the quality of wine youâ€™re about to take home, and ensures that you make the right decision. Cheers! ðŸ¥‚

### How to Use

Clone the entire repository. Run the WineAboutIt.py script. Make sure the necessary python libraries are installed. Once sucessfully run, a window will pop up with the tool. Enter sugar and alcohol content values of the wine in percentages. A rating of the wine will be returned!!
